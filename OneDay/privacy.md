# Privacy Policy

We hope you will find this privacy policy clear and transparent. 

## Article 1  What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?  

1. The Application does not provide an option to create an account therefore, we do not store nor have access to your entries and data. Your data are stored only locally on your device and all calculations are done on your device as well. You can optionally backup your data to Google Drive (Android) or to Apple iCloud (iOS). Your backups are stored in your private cloud space and we donâ€™t have access to your backup files.
2. We obtain your email address when you request support via email or customer support contact form. We use your email only to contact you to provide support, feedback or important information.

## Article 2  Backup

We advise our users to regularly backup their data. Our users can choose to manually export the backup file and store it wherever they want or they can optionally make cloud backups. The cloud backups are kept in users' private cloud space where we have no access.

### Article 3  Analytics

1. Our application may collect some anonymized usage data that are essential for us to deliver our services, to understand your needs, and to improve our services. Such as app launches, taps, clicks, scrolling information, in-app purchases, screen visits, session durations, or other information about how users interact with our app. These data are fully anonymized and aggregated and thus not linked to any particular user. The application may also collect crashes and performance reports so we can improve the stability and performance of our app.
2. The application does NOT collect any user-generated content. Such as your name, surname, email, photos, or anything you type within the app. Your entries and memories are truly private and fully under your control.
