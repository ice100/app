# Privacy Policy

## Dark Browser does not collect any of your data. 
The only data Dark Browser(the "App") stores are your settings. These are only saved locally, and never leave your device. No one, other than you, has access to this data.

Because of the way this kind of extension works, the App extension needs to have permission to access every website. This is needed because the App has to analyze the existing style of a website, and override it with the App's dark style. However, the App will never use these permissions to actually read the websites you visit, or to access your browsing history. **The App does not store any information about the websites you're visiting.** Not even locally on your device.

### Reporting an issue
If you decide to report an issue with a website through the email, and your email will only be used for two purposes: to contact you in case more information about the issue is needed, and possibly to inform you when the issue has been resolved. Your email address will not be used for any other purposes. After the reported issue is resolved, your email address will be removed from the report.

If you have any additional questions or remarks, feel free to reach out to me! You can reach me at [helpforapp1024@gmail.com](helpforapp1024@gmail.com).
